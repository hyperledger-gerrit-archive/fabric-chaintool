# System Chaincode Platform

System chaincode is a special variant of [org.hyperledger.chaincode.golang](golang.md) designed for system-chaincode development as an extension of the hyperledger fabric.  This platform is implicitly golang based and notably not compiled as system chaincode is compiled as part of the fabric build.
